# MoroccoGuideBot : Enhancing Moroccan Tourism

This project develops a  Chatboot application that enhances the tourism experience in Morocco. The app provides detailed information on historical monuments.


## Problem
Tourism in Morocco faces several challenges for visitors. Among these challenges are:

- **Language Barriers**: Tourists may struggle to communicate with locals, especially in rural areas where foreign languages are less commonly spoken.
- **Navigation Difficulties**: Navigating unfamiliar cities and finding points of interest can be challenging, particularly without prior knowledge of the local geography.
- **Limited Access to Local Information**: Information about tourist attractions, local events, cultural customs, and local recommendations is not always easily accessible or up-to-date.


## Proposed Solution 

To address these challenges, we have developed a chatbot application that enhances the tourism experience in Morocco. 

- provides detailed information on historical monuments, places to visit in a city , hotels ..
- suggest Tours 
- Generating information about historical monuments from pictures
- The user provides the chatbot with their budget, and it recommends hotels and dining options accordingly.
## Dataset used 
Datasource : Fondation Nationale des Musées.

We also collect data from various sources, such us website , pdfs ...

## Model used

### Large Language Model: Mistral 7B Instruct

Our application leverages the **Mistral 7B Instruct** model, hosted by Hugging Face. This model is a state-of-the-art language model optimized for understanding and generating human-like text based on the input it receives. We specifically chose this model for its ability to process complex queries and generate detailed, contextually relevant responses. This capability is fundamental to providing accurate and useful information in response to user queries.

### Data Indexing with Llama Index

The backend of our application utilizes the `llama_index` library to create a searchable index of data sourced from PDF documents. Here’s how it works:

- **Data Collection**: Our data consists of PDF documents which are rich in content but not readily searchable. We selected PDFs because they often contain detailed, structured information that is valuable for our use case. Additionally, there are limited datasets available for fine-tuning in this specific field..

- **Data Processing**: Using `llama_index`'s `SimpleDirectoryReader`, we process each PDF document to extract text. This text extraction is crucial as it converts non-searchable image-based pages into searchable text data.

- **Indexing**: Post extraction, the text data is indexed using `VectorStoreIndex` from the `llama_index` library. This indexing process involves transforming the text into high-dimensional vectors that can be rapidly searched. We utilize embeddings generated by a model specifically tuned for document understanding, which helps in maintaining the semantic context of the indexed data.

- **Search Capability**: The indexed data allows our application to perform quick and efficient searches across the entire corpus of documents. Users can input natural language queries, which are then matched against the indexed data to retrieve the most relevant information.
