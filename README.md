# MoroccoGuideBot : Enhancing Moroccan Tourism

This project develops a  Chatboot application that enhances the tourism experience in Morocco. The app provides detailed information on historical monuments.


## Problem
Tourism in Morocco faces several challenges for visitors. Among these challenges are:

- **Language Barriers**: Tourists may struggle to communicate with locals, especially in rural areas where foreign languages are less commonly spoken.
- **Navigation Difficulties**: Navigating unfamiliar cities and finding points of interest can be challenging, particularly without prior knowledge of the local geography.
- **Limited Access to Local Information**: Information about tourist attractions, local events, cultural customs, and local recommendations is not always easily accessible or up-to-date.


## Proposed Solution 

To address these challenges, we have developed a chatbot application that enhances the tourism experience in Morocco. 

- provides detailed information on historical monuments, places to visit in a city , hotels ..
- suggest Tours 
- Generating information about historical monuments from pictures
- The user provides the chatbot with their budget, and it recommends hotels and dining options accordingly.
